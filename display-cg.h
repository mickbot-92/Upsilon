// gint:display-cg - fx-CG 50 rendering functions
//
// This module covers rendering functions specific to the fx-CG 50. In addition
// to triple-buffering management, this mainly includes image manipulation
// tools as well as the very versatile dimage_effect() and dsubimage_effect()
// functions that support high-performance image rendering with a number of
// geometric and color effects.
//
// The fx-CG OS restricts the display to a 384x216 rectangle rougly around the
// center, leaving margins on three sides. However, gint configures the display
// to use the full 396x224 surface!

/* dsetvram(): Control video RAM address and triple buffering

   Normal rendering under gint uses double-buffering: there is one image
   displayed on the screen and one in memory, in a region called the video RAM
   (VRAM). The application draws frames in the VRAM then sends them to the
   screen only when they are finished, using dupdate().

   On fx-CG, sending frames with dupdate() is a common bottleneck because it
   takes about 11 ms. Fortunately, while the DMA is sending the frame to the
   display, the CPU is available to do work in parallel. This function sets up
   triple buffering (ie. a second VRAM) so that the CPU can start working on
   the next frame while the DMA is sending the current one.

   However, experience shows minimal performance improvements, because writing
   to main RAM does not parallelize with DMA transfers. Since gint 2.8, this
   is no longer the default, and the memory for the extra VRAM is instead
   available via malloc().

   VRAMs must be contiguous, 32-aligned, (2*396*224)-byte buffers with 32 bytes
   of extra data on each side (ie. 32 bytes into a 32-aligned buffer of size
   177472).

   @main       Main VRAM area, used alone if [secondary] is NULL
   @secondary  Additional VRAM area, enables triple buffering if non-NULL */
// TODO: In gint 3 the triple buffering mechanism will be removed. Applications
// that want to change VRAMs in-between every frame will be able to do so by
// talking directly to the video interface to set VRAM, and wrapping dupdate.
// Basically it will just no longer be handled by gint itself.

   [*in_end] is excluded from the encoding, it will be modified temporarily to
   serve as bounds check, so it must not be accessed asynchronously during the
   encoding. The size of the output is not known but is at most the distance
   between in_end and in_start in bytes. Setting output = in_start to compress
   in-place is supported. Returns the end pointer after encoding. */
